# Flutter TODO App with CRUD Functionality using Hive

A Flutter TODO App

## Getting Started

This is a simple Flutter TODO app that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Hive for local storage. The app allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. It features a checkbox for task completion status and displays the current date at the top of the screen.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title.
- Mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox.
- Update task details and completion status.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Tasks are stored locally using Hive, ensuring persistence between app launches.
- Current date is displayed prominently for easy reference.
